# SPAM-SMS-DETECTION-CODSOFT

Spam SMS Detection using Machine Learning

This project, completed during my CodSoft internship, aims to identify spam messages in SMS communications using machine learning.

Project Overview

Using a labeled dataset of SMS messages, we built a model to classify texts as spam or legitimate (ham).

Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and tokenized text data; applied TF-IDF for vectorization.


2. EDA: Analyzed word frequency patterns to understand common spam indicators.


3. Modeling: Trained models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM, evaluating with accuracy, precision, and recall.



Results

The final model achieved high accuracy in identifying spam, showcasing the utility of machine learning in enhancing messageÂ filtering.
